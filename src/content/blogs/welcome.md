# Welcome to the Future

This portfolio is built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It features a "Glowing Modern" aesthetic designed to impress.

## Tech Stack

-   **Framework**: React (Vite)
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
-   **Animations**: Framer Motion
-   **Icons**: Lucide React

## How it Works

The blog system you are reading right now uses **Markdown**. I can simply drop `.md` files into the `src/content/blogs` directory, and they automatically appear here!

### Code Snippet

```javascript
const future = "now";
console.log(`The future is ${future}`);
```

Stay tuned for more updates!
